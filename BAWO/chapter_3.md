## The epsilon-Greedy Algorithm 
### Introducing the epsilon-Greedy Algorithm
Greedy Algorithm
- always takes whatever action seems best at the present moment
- even when that decision might lead to bad long term consequences.

epsilon-Greedy Algorithm
- 'almost' Greedy
  * generally exploits the best available option
  * once in a while explores the other available options
  * BIG IDEA : flip a coin, and depending on the result either 
    * Explore for a whle
    * Exploit
