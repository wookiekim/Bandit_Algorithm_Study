## Two Characters: Exploration and Exploitation

### The Scientist and the Businessman
- A scientist who explores and a businessman who exploits
- Works as characters to help understand the concept of exploration, exploitation, and the dilemma between the two.

Deb Knull (web entrepreneur) has a problem:
- Thinks about changing color of site logo
- Which may make users feel more comfortable, therefore making them buy more products the site was selling.
- But worried the new colour may actually make users feel less comfortable, leading to less sales.
- Decides to ask advice from Cynthia (scientist) and Bob (businessman).

Cynthia (the scientist) likes the idea of logo change:
- Suggests controlled experiment - the colour change in the logo may NOT be responsible for whatever happens next.
  * Christmas is soon, so whatever happens the logo, the sales may increase.
- Suggests an A/B test, dividing the users to two different groups of original logo v. the new logo. This way 'any factors that might distort the comparison between the two logos should balance out over time'.
- Deb acknowledged this idea, but thought of comparing a total of 7 different logos instead (including the original), making it a A/B/C/D/E/F/G test.

Bob (the businessman) doesn't wholeheartedly agree with Cynthia:
- Agrees that the experimentation may be profitable.
- But sketpcial about trying out all sorts of ideas.
- Suggests only running experiments that could be profitable.
- If an idea does not have the potential to be valuable, don't even try.
- Contrasts with Cynthia's idea of trying out many different types of logos.

Deb believe there should be a balance between *learning from new things* and *profiting from old things*.

Oscar (the Operations Researcher) agrees that Deb should find a balance:
- Refers to the balance as **Explore-Exploit trade-off**.
- Experimentation - Exploration, Profit-maximization - Exploitation.
- Too much exploration - lose money
- Too much exploitation - stagnate and miss new opportunities.
- The A/B test should be planned in more detail (trial period, trial season [ex. Halloween vs Christmas colours], etc..)

### The Explore-Exploit Dilemma

Two different goals to be addressed when optimizing a website:
1. Learn about new ideas (Exploring)
2. Take advantage of the best of old ideas (Exploiting)
